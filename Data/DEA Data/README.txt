The GramsPer100KEachYear.csv file contains the aggregated data from the other files, and shows 
the number of grams of fentanyl sold in each state per 100K people in that state every year 
from 2006 to 2018.  The fentanyl sales interactive map on Brian's Tableau page uses this file 
to build the map, and uses a slider to navigate through the years.  The darkness of each state 
represents how much fentanyl was sold per 100K people.

The visualization is available on Brian's Tableau Public page here:
